## Introduction

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds static typing, classes, interfaces, and other features to JavaScript, making it easier to build and maintain large-scale applications.

## Key Features

- Static typing: TypeScript enables the use of static types, which helps catch errors during development.
- Object-oriented programming: TypeScript supports classes, interfaces, inheritance, and other object-oriented programming concepts.
- Enhanced tooling: TypeScript provides better tooling support, including autocompletion, code navigation, and refactoring.
- Compatibility with existing JavaScript code: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, so you can gradually migrate existing JavaScript codebases to TypeScript.
